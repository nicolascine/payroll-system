# üöÄ Payroll System Demo Guide

A comprehensive guide for demonstrating the Payroll Management System's key features and capabilities.

## üìã Prerequisites

Ensure all services are running:
```bash
# Start all services
make build
make up

# Verify services are running
docker-compose ps
```

## üéØ Demo Walkthrough

### 1. Basic Single Employee Payroll
```bash
# Calculate payroll for one employee (regular hours only)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/payroll/calculate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "companyId": 1,
  "period": "2024-03",
  "attendanceList": [{
    "employeeId": 1,
    "regularHours": 160,
    "overtimeHours": 0,
    "sickLeaveHours": 0,
    "absenceHours": 0,
    "vacationHours": 0
  }]
}'

# Expected Response:
{
  "jobId": "1",
  "message": "Payroll calculation queued"
}

# Check calculation results
curl http://localhost:3001/api/payroll/job/1

# Expected Result:
{
  "employeeId": 1,
  "regularPay": 3200,    # 160 hours √ó $20/hour
  "overtimePay": 0,
  "sickLeavePay": 0,
  "vacationPay": 0,
  "grossPay": 3200,
  "deductions": 640,     # 20% tax rate
  "netPay": 2560
}
```

### 2. Complex Multi-Employee Scenario
```bash
# Calculate payroll for multiple employees with different scenarios
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/payroll/calculate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "companyId": 1,
  "period": "2024-03",
  "attendanceList": [
    {
      "employeeId": 1,
      "regularHours": 160,
      "overtimeHours": 10,    # Overtime scenario
      "sickLeaveHours": 0,
      "absenceHours": 0,
      "vacationHours": 0
    },
    {
      "employeeId": 2,
      "regularHours": 152,
      "overtimeHours": 0,
      "sickLeaveHours": 8,    # Sick leave scenario
      "absenceHours": 0,
      "vacationHours": 0
    },
    {
      "employeeId": 3,
      "regularHours": 144,
      "overtimeHours": 0,
      "sickLeaveHours": 0,
      "absenceHours": 0,
      "vacationHours": 16    # Vacation scenario
    }
  ]
}'
```

### 3. Queue Monitoring

#### A. Visual Interface
1. Open Bull Board UI: http://localhost:3001/admin/queues
2. Demonstrate:
   - Active jobs list
   - Job progress tracking
   - Completed jobs history
   - Failed jobs and retry mechanism
   - Job details and results

#### B. API Monitoring
```bash
# Get queue statistics
curl http://localhost:3001/api/payroll/queue/info

# Expected Response:
{
  "active": 1,
  "waiting": 2,
  "completed": 5,
  "failed": 0,
  "jobs": {
    "active": [{"id": "123", "timestamp": "2024-01-17T14:30:00.000Z"}],
    "waiting": [...],
    "completed": [...],
    "failed": []
  }
}

# Get specific job details
curl http://localhost:3001/api/payroll/job/123

# Expected Response:
{
  "id": "123",
  "state": "completed",
  "progress": 100,
  "result": { ... },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-17T14:30:00.000Z",
  "processedOn": "2024-01-17T14:30:01.000Z",
  "finishedOn": "2024-01-17T14:30:02.000Z"
}
```

## üìä Key Demo Points

### 1. Payroll Calculation Features
- Base salary calculation ($20/hour)
- Overtime premium (1.5x base rate)
- Paid leave handling (sick leave, vacation)
- Tax deductions (20% rate)
- Multi-employee processing

### 2. Queue System Benefits
- Asynchronous processing
- Job progress tracking
- Automatic retries on failure
- Real-time monitoring
- Scalability potential

### 3. Error Handling
```bash
# Demonstrate validation with invalid data
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/payroll/calculate \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "companyId": 1,
  "period": "2024-03",
  "attendanceList": [{
    "employeeId": 1,
    "regularHours": -160,    # Invalid negative hours
    "overtimeHours": 0
  }]
}'

# Expected Response:
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": ["regularHours must be a positive number"]
}
```

## üîç Debugging Guide

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# View backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Monitor Redis queue
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli monitor

# Check queue status
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli
```

### Common Issues

1. Queue Connection Issues
```bash
# Reset Redis
docker-compose restart redis

# Verify Redis connection
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping
```

2. Service Health Check
```bash
# Check all services
docker-compose ps

# View specific service logs
docker-compose logs -f [service_name]
```
